# Diabetes-Prediction-in-R

*Objective:*

To develop predictive models to assess the likelihood of diabetes in individuals by employing Logistic Regression, K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), and Random Forest algorithms using R.


*Features:*

1. Data Preprocessing: Handles missing values and scales features appropriately.
2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Provides insights into data distribution and relationships.
3. Model Implementation: Develop and train three distinct models—Logistic Regression, KNN, and Random Forest—to predict diabetes occurrence.
4. Model Evaluation: Assesses model performance using appropriate metrics.
5. Comparative Analysis: Compare the efficacy of the three models to determine the most reliable predictor for diabetes.



*Usage:*

1. Install Required R Packages:  
2. Load the Dataset
3. Perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
4. Preprocess the Data
5. Train the Model
6. Evaluate the Model
7. Make Predictions
